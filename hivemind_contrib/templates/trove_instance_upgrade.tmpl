Dear NeCTAR Research Cloud User,

Due to a recent upgrade for our database service, one or more of your mysql database
instances need to be upgraded through NeCTAR Dashboard or CLI to apply the new mysql
image(version 5.7-8).


IMPACT:

Database instances that are running on old versions of mysql will have the problem to
perform the backup and restore.


ACTION REQUIRED:

* Backup your data by dumping the mysql database before you start following steps.
  \s1. Go to https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au/project/databases/
  \s2. Click on the dropdown in the Actions column of the affected instances.
  \s3. Select Upgrade Instance and then choose the 5.7-8 as the new version.
  \s4. Click Upgrade Databse Instance

* Alternatively, you could use the CLI to do the database instances upgrade.
  <ul>
  {% for instance in instances -%}
    <li>trove upgrade {{ instance.id }} 5.7-8</li>
  {%- endfor %}
  </ul>
* Please finish above steps before 31 October 2018, otherwise, we will do that
  as your representive.

* If you are no longer using the instance(s) listed below, please delete/terminate them.


AFFECTED DATABASES INSTANCES:
<table border = "1">
  <tr><th align="left">UUID</th><th align="left">IP Address</th><th align="left">Host</th><th align="left">Project</th></tr>
{% for instance in instances -%}
